 # Retirement Planning Simulation Guide

This guide will help you set up Python and an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) so you can run a retirement planning simulation code. Follow these steps even if you've never used Python before.

## Step 1: Install Python

### 1.1 Download Python
- Go to the official Python website: [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Click on the latest version (make sure itâ€™s Python 3.x).
- Download the installer for your operating system (Windows, Mac, or Linux).

### 1.2 Install Python
- Open the downloaded file to start the installation.
- **IMPORTANT:** Make sure to check the box that says **"Add Python to PATH"** before you click "Install Now." This will make Python accessible from any folder on your computer.

### 1.3 Verify Installation
1. Open the Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac/Linux).
2. Type `python --version` and press Enter.
   - If Python is installed correctly, you should see the version number, like `Python 3.10.4`.

## Step 2: Install an IDE (Visual Studio Code)

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is an easy-to-use IDE for writing and running Python code.

### 2.1 Download Visual Studio Code
- Go to the [Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- Download the installer for your operating system and follow the instructions to install.

### 2.2 Install Python Extension in Visual Studio Code
1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Click on the **Extensions** icon on the left sidebar.
3. In the search bar, type **Python**.
4. Install the extension called **"Python"** by Microsoft.

## Step 3: Install Required Python Packages

Our code uses specific packages for data fetching and analysis. These can be installed via **pip** (Python's package manager).

### 3.1 Open Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac/Linux)
1. Type each of the following commands one by one and press Enter:
   pip install yfinance
   pip install numpy
   pip install pandas

## Step 4: Download and Save the Code

1. Copy the code for the Retirement Planning Simulation provided below.
2. Open Visual Studio Code and create a new file by selecting **File > New File**.
3. Paste the copied code into this new file.
4. Save the file with the name `retirement_simulation.py` by selecting **File > Save As** and entering the filename.

## Step 5: Run the Code

1. In Visual Studio Code, open the **Terminal** by selecting **View > Terminal** from the top menu.
2. In the terminal, type the following command and press Enter:
   python retirement_simulation.py
